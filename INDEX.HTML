    <h1>I love cricket</h1>
    <p>
        Cricket is a globally popular bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of eleven players, originating in England but now beloved in Commonwealth nations, involving batting, bowling, and fielding to score runs on an oval field with wickets at each end, with formats ranging from multi-day Test matches to T20s, teaching strategy, fitness, and teamwork. The core objective is simple: the batting team tries to score as many runs as possible while the fielding team tries to get their batters out, with the highest score winning the match.
